# HAL: Handy Algorithmic Library

## Aim
* create multi-purpose library of mathematics algorithms and every-day methods
* make things easier when writing python code

## Solution
* class wrappers when functions can possibly be attributed to single instance of object

## Install
* Fire up a terminal and type `python3 setup.py install`: this will take care of all needed other modules and dependencies. Note that you can also install it by one cmd command: `mkdir hal_install && cd hal_install && git clone https://github.com/sirfoga/hal.git && cd hal && python3 setup.py install`
