# HAL: Handy Algorithmic Library

## Aim
* create multi-purpose library of mathematics algorithms and every-day methods
* make things easier when writing python code

## Solution
* class wrappers when functions can possibly be attributed to single instance of object
* easy-to-remember names

## Install
* You can either open a terminal and type in `python setup.py install` (this will take care of all needed other modules and dependencies) or ...
* ... install dependencies yourself by running the bash script provided (`chmod +x install-dependencies.sh && ./install-dependencies.sh`), and then place all module stuff in your python library folder (you can get the location by running `python -m site --user-site`)
