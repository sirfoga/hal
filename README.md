# HAL: Handy Algorithmic Library

## Aim
* create library of scritpt-like functions and small classes
* make things easier when writing python code

## Examples
As of now, no documentation is available (too few classes and functions) but if you wish to find some examples, you can take a look at [my other repository](https://github.com/sirfoga): there are lots of implementations from various HAL modules.

## Install
* Download package and fire up a terminal and type `python3 setup.py install`: this will take care of all needed other modules and dependencies.
* You can also install via pip: `pip3 install git+https://github.com/sirfoga/hal.git`.
