INTRO = "So, let\'s get into the details.. I\'m going to solve the " \
        "classic Eight Queens Puzzle: it\'s the problem of placing " \
        "eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two " \
        "queens threaten each other.\nFinding all solutions to the " \
        "eight queens puzzle is a good example of a nontrivial " \
        "problem. For this reason, it is often used as an example " \
        "problem for various programming techniques, including " \
        "non-traditional approaches such as constraint programming," \
        " logic programming or genetic algorithms. Most often, " \
        "it is used as an example of a problem that can be solved " \
        "with a recursive algorithm (read more here: " \
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) ... and" \
        " since recursion involves both RAM storage and CPU use of " \
        "your machine, this problem is a good tester to test your " \
        "PC speed! Now let\'s get started.. "
